## Prerequisites

**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
Node.js. That's all you need.

```sh
node -v // v9.2.0
```

## Getting Started

### Running Development Server

#### npm

Run server

```sh
npm install
npm dev
```

Open a new terminal to run database

```sh
```

#### yarn

Run server

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open a new terminal to run database

```sh
```

### Running Production Server

#### npm

Run server

```sh
npm install
npm prod
```

Open a new terminal to run database

```sh
```

#### yarn

Run server

```sh
yarn
yarn prod
```

Open a new terminal to run database

```sh
```

## Available Scripts

### Server

#### Test
Preparing...
Maybe like this

```sh
yarn test
```

So simple!

Actually, it's just a plan yet.


### Client

Will make new repository **zabo-client-reactjs** soon.
 
## Running Tests

### Break down into end to end tests

Will be prepared

## Deployment

Additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system will be added soon.

## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ko/) - Used to build server.

> Note: Planing to use 
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc1=h_ls) - Amazon S3(Simple Storage Service) is an object storage service that offers nice scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
* [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/) - Continuous Integration.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Widely used free to use NoSQL database.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerizate software.

## Database

### MongoDB

Administrative information such as authentication will be stored in MongoDB.

### S3

Pictures are going to be stored in S3.

## Commit Message Guidelines

I referred [Google's Angular JS's contributor's commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) to format commit messages. This leads to more **unified** and **readable messages** helping further history lookups and even CI integrations.

By the way, this repository's commit messages format is not exactly same as the one suggested above.

### Commit Message Format 

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/sparcs-kaist/zabo-server-nodejs/commits/master))

```
docs(README): update README adding instruction on how to start docker on EC2
```
```
build(babel): Add babel preset-env

Add @babel/core, @babel/preset-env and register with @babel/register.
Entry point of the application is set to be bin/www_es6.js
Refer to the package.json file to fidn out more.
```

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Should be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **misc**: Adding miscellaneous items

### Scope
There's no specific recommendations for naming scope yet.
Feel free to write your own scopes.

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the **imperative, present tense**: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* **do capitalize** the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
If the commit derives changes from previous behavior, the body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
